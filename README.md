# Pong
According to Wikipedia, Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell.

This project is basically the remake of Pong. This game has some faults as it's an infinite game, which I made on purpose to kill time. It can be changed by just a tweak. Also one bug is there, when you collide with the ball on 90 and just smash in on top or bottom wall, then it vanishes. I can't solve it yet, as I am new on this field. I will do it when I'm better.
